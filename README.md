Analyze the district-wide standardized test results. Aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


# PyCitySchools Evaluation

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. Utilizes Python and Pandas, version 3.10, through Juypter notebook.

## Purpose

To get a thorough view of the data, the anaylsis breaks the data down by:
-District
-School
-Performance
-Grade level
-Spending
-School Size
-School Type

To look at key metrics across a wide range of perspectives in order to see which factors might most impact student performance.

This data does not include any information about at-home support the students may receive, or fail to receice, that could also impact school performance.


Tutor Sandhya helped me get started with the District Summary information. Tutor Reza helped me get started with the School Summary information.


## Result

- Charter schools perform better, with 90% of the overall student population passing compared to 53% armong District schools.

- Within both Charter and District schools, a greater percent of students are passing Reading than are passing Math. The difference is less pronounced among Charter schools, with 96% passing reading and 93% passing math, compared to District schools 80% and 66%, respectively.

- Small and Medium-sized schools, with student populations under 2000, perform better than large schools, with over 90% of their students passing Reading and Math, and an overall pass rate right around 90% - 89% for school populations under 1000, 90% for schools between 1000 and 2000, compared to 82% and 69% passing Reading and Math, respectively, at Large (>2000) schools, and a 58% overall passing rate.

- Student performance is lowest across the board for Per Student Spending in the highest spending bracket ($645 - 680) and highest for th lowest Per Student Spending bracket ($0-585)

- Student performance is largely consistent across grade levels within each individual schools for Reading and Math.

- The bottom 5 schools By Percent Overall Passing are all District schools with more than 2000 students and per student budgets above $630.00

- The highest performing schools By Percent Overall Passing are all Charter schools. Most have fewer than 2000 students. The per student budget varies.

- Based on this data, smaller Charter schools get the best results for the lowest per student expenditure. This suggests that for larger schools to get better results, they need to emulate the smaller schools.



## Summary
In conclusion, this analysis has shown that more money is not the solution to better performance among students on standardized tests. Charter schools boast better averages in math and reading, and a higher percent passing overall. The data further suggests that smaller schools may be able to provide students with greater assistance with less monetary investment.
